    <p>My target audience would be people that collect sneakers or just people that happen to want to buy or sell sneakers. My message is mostly supporting a brand, which would be Air Jordan. My design supports this message through pictures of products containg the Air Jordan logo and using Michael Jordan's team colors, they're also a theme of colors that every shoe is available in. I also provided a little history on the brand and Michael Jordan along with his coach and some teammates that helped him blow up as much as he did. My ultimate goal if this was real would be to attract people to the website to make it work. My design supports the goal by providing easy to read and understand information as well as a simple contact form and plenty of pictures.</p>
